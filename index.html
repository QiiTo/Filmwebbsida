    <h2>Story: </h2>

    <p>The Action/comdey movie " mall cop 2" released in 2015 is about a security guard (mall cop) who travels
        to las vegas with his daughter to a yearly convention. During the convention Paul realizes that
        something fishy is going on and this leads to him planning a way to save the day. Wether its tasers,
        silly string or bowling balls we watch as he saves the day mixed with humour and action. </p>

    <h3>Review:</h3>
    <p>In my opinion this movie is great as it includes a lot of action and comedy whilst also maintaning
        tension
        throughout the movie with subtle notes and refferances to the Oceans franchise. It is directed more
        towards
        the younger audiences as it is not neccesarily the best
        movie if you are looking for suspense and action.
        The movie is targeted towards younger audiences because of the language and comedy used in the movies.
